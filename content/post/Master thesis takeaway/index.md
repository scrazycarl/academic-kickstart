Last year, during this time, I was sprinting my last month of work for my master thesis. At that time, I had the general impression the result won't be too bad.
1 month after that I finished my master thesis and submitted. From the beginning of my thesis work, I had a clear goal in mind to obtain a great grade for it. 

I finished my thesis 1 month later. Until this day, I still remember when I walked into the assistant's office, I felt quite anxious. My heart was beating fast as if I 
missed something crucial. However, when I tried to calm down and go through the details, I couldn't find any thing that led to the anxiety. 

2-3 month later, I finally received my grade. It was waaayyy lower than my expectation. I just couldn't make my head around it, because even my supervisor were saying 
"great job", "well done" all the time.

 
In retrospect, my thesis wasn't perfect. Somethings could be done differently. One the biggest reason that I received a low grade was : "He works hard and fast, but without a plan."
Although I had a plan at that time, it turns out I still failed my thesis to my standard. 

If I have a chance to do it differently, I would rethink it on the following aspect:

1. Having a plan is great, but how do you manage it

2. Waterfall project management VS agile project management

3. Balance between being independent and asking questions from supervisors

4. Writing style and perfection

5. Communication and expectation management

6. Motivation source: find the motivation from within, not without
